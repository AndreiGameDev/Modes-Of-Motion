# Modes of Motion

A collection of different motion techniques, including easing-based lerping, camera shake, rigidbody pushing, and object-focused linear lerping.

## Easing-Based Lerping
Smooth object transitions using various easing functions.

Each easing mode operates within its designated chamber.
